## [What is Django](https://docs.appseed.us/what-is/django/)

:point_right: Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

<br />

## Install Django

:point_right: The easiest way to install [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is to use [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/) the official package-management tool.

```bash
$ pip install django
```

<br />

**How to check Flask version**

Open a Python console (type python in terminal) and check the installed version as below:

```python
>> import django
>> django.__version__
'3.1.7' 
>>>
```

In this case the installed version is **3.1.7**
