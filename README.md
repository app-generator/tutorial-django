## What is Django

:point_right: Flask is a lightweight web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
Compared to [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), Flask provides a lightweight codebase and more freedom to the developer.

## Install Django

:point_right: The easiest way to install [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is to use [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/) the official package-management tool.

```bash
$ pip install django
```

<br />

**How to check Flask version**

Open a Python console (type python in terminal) and check the installed version as below:

```python
>> import django
>> django.__version__
'3.1.7' 
>>>
```

In this case the installed version is **3.1.7**
